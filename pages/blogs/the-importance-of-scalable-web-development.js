                    Scalable Web Development refers to the ability of a system,
                    network, and the process of using the website to handle the
                    workload that would increase as time passes by.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is usually calculated, to help the Operations&apos; ;
                    team to assess, evaluate, and ensure the process does not go
                    out of hand. It is calculated through the ratio of the
                    increase in system performance to the rise in resources
                    used.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It must be understood that building scalable websites helps
                    in high productivity and it would further improve the
                    working style of the company. When we look at websites of
                    well-established and renowned companies, most of us
                    don&#39;t realize the kind of workload that these websites
                    can withstand.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is why, when small businesses wish to develop a
                    website, they must have a buffer stock and must consider the
                    number of customers who might visit their website at once.
                    This would help their customers to not experience any
                    obstacles like:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <div className="ml-[3rem]">
                      <ul className="list-disc">
                        <li className="px-[10px] py-[5px] text-[#333] text-xs xl:text-base font-light break-words">
                          The web page not loading
                        </li>
                        <li className="px-[10px] py-[5px] text-[#333] text-xs xl:text-base font-light break-words">
                          Taking a lot of time to load
                        </li>
                        <li className="px-[10px] py-[5px] text-[#333] text-xs xl:text-base font-light break-words">
                          Not being able to produce relevant data, due to a high
                          number of people using the page, and much more.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    For e-commerce websites, expansion of the product range
                    negatively affects the page load time; updating the
                    inventory of an e-commerce shop also becomes problematic,
                    Changing the code structure becomes dangerous and
                    overcomplicated. Adding a new product or service takes too
                    much time and becomes expensive. Do all websites inevitably
                    face such problems?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To a certain extent, yes. Websites do face complex issues
                    during every step of the development process. It completely
                    depends on how well they have improvised with the current
                    trends and technology advancements.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If certain rules are followed concerning the application
                    setup, it would pave the way to:
