The ultimate goal is that at the end of each day you go to bed with zero stress, and wake up the next morning with a smile on your face and a spring in your steps. Many people consider work and their personal lives to be two separate entities, when in fact they go hand-in-hand.

Proper planning will not only help you manage your time better but will also give you the satisfaction of meeting all your deadlines.
